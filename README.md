# Installation

If you're building the project from source, the project files are configured to output the build artifacts to the Australian vatSys profile.
Building the project should automatically install the plugin for you.

Otherwise, place the plugin files into your vatSys plugins directory (`%documents%\vatSys Files\Profiles\Australia\Plugins\Maestro`).
You will also need to copy the `Maestro.json` file into your profile directory (`%documents%\vatSys Files\Profiles\Australia`).
If you have a large screen resolution, you may need to run the `dpiaware-fix.bat` file to disable DPI awareness for vatSys.

Logs will be written to the vatSys installation directory under `MaestroLogs`.

# Known Issues 

- Desequence and Information windows do not re-draw
- The Debug window always moves to the back of the stack when moving your mouse cursor over a vatSys window.
- When a button is enabled, it's appearance is still disabled, but it is still interactable.
- The ladder occasionally stop updating.
- Desequence window can be re-opened multiple times.
- Diversions result in weird behaviour.
- Stable flights don't seem to get updated ETAs.
- Recompute, ETA_FF and STA_FF update, but STA doesn't.
- Resuming a desequenced flight does not work
- Q: Should times from vatSys be rounded to the nearest 30 secs?
