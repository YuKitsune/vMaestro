# TODOs

- [ ] Extract scheduling from sequence
    - [ ] Avoid re-ordering in the scheduler
    - [ ] Determine insertion point from handlers
- [ ] Simplify Sequence to use basic methods
    - Insert at position
    - Move to position
    - Swap positions
    - Remove at position
    - No references to times, that's the schedulers job
- [ ] Refactor insertion and move requests to use indexes rather than times
- [ ] Review tests cases
