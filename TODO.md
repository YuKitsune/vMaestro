# Questions

If a runway change is scheduled for some time in the future, and a flight is delayed past the `LastLandingTimeInPreviousMode`, what happens?
Does the flight get moved to a runway in the new mode, or will it remain on its assigned runway?
Does the flight get scheduled between `LastLandingTimeInPreviousMode` and `FirstLandingTimeInNewMode`, or is it delayed until `FirstLandingTimeInNewMode`?
