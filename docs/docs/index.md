vMaestro is a [vatSys](https://virtualairtrafficsystem.com) plugin that emulates the Maestro Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS), designed to assist air traffic controllers in sequencing arrival traffic.

## Quick Start

Ready to get started? Follow the [Installation Guide](user-guide/01-installation) to install and configure the vMaestro plugin.

## Key Features

Using real-time data from vatSys, vMaestro provides comprehensive traffic flow management:

- **Automatic Runway Assignment** - Intelligently allocates incoming flights to appropriate runways based on feeder fixes and aircraft performance
- **Optimised Scheduling** - Calculates the optimum landing time and feeder fix time to minimise delay while maintaining safe separation
- **Visual Timeline** - Displays the sequence in a vertically scrolling timeline for easy monitoring and management
- **Speed Control Suggestions** - Provides suggested speed adjustments to absorb delays efficiently
- **Manual Control** - Allows controllers to interact with the sequence to reflect their own strategy and operational requirements
- **Multi-User Support** - Supports online collaboration through the optional server component

## Documentation Sections

This documentation is organized into three main sections:

- **[User Guide](./user-guide/01-installation.md)** - How to install, configure, and use vMaestro
- **[Configuration Guide](./configuration-guide)** - Detailed configuration options and airport setup
